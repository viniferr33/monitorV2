# monitorV2
A web app to management and monitoring the AquaNova APP resources

As a semester project of 2/2020 me and my Team have developed an APP to make the communication about water distribution services more easier.
The MonitorV2 is the administration panel for the app, where you can add warnings, news or emergency advices and visualize data from users.

I developed the monitor using Flask, a microframework for web development in Python, as a web app, it could be used at any computer with a active internet connection.
