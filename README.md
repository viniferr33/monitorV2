# monitorV2
A web app to management and monitoring the AquaNova APP resources

As a semester project of 2/2020 me and my Team have developed an APP to make the communication about water distribution services more easier.
The MonitorV2 is the administration panel for the app, where you can add warnings, news or emergency advices and visualize data from users.
